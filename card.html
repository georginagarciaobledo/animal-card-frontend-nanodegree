			<p>These tiny invertebrates are perhaps the toughest life forms we know. They don't like living in extreme conditions (they are not extremophiles), but are able to survive in incredibly challenging conditions. They can even survive in outer space! They are able to withstand extreme conditions by drying themselves out when necessary and rehydrating themselves when possible. Tardigrades are also called water bears or moss piglets. </p>
